# About Project
"Vasara" in Lithuanian means "summer." Such are the stories â€“ joyful and sunny when they are meant to bring a smile, rainy when they break hearts, stormy when the action keeps you hooked. And always too short, with the best ones being remembered for years.

Because writing stories is my personal hobby I'm using many different writing platforms and I decived to create my own as my personal project.

(Vasara is still under development)
