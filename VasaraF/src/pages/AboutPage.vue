  <h3>About Project</h3>
  <p>
    "Vasara" in Lithuanian means "summer." Such are the stories â€“ joyful and
    sunny when they are meant to bring a smile, rainy when they break hearts,
    stormy when the action keeps you hooked. And always too short, with the best
    ones being remembered for years.
